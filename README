##swisclient - A Ruby Gem for interacting with the Solarwinds Information Service

We use [Solarwinds](http://www.solarwinds.com/) for monitoring.  It is useful for us to automate various CRUD tasks.  This is just an attempt to package our custom stuff up a bit neater so it can be reused.

##Install

I will eventually push this up to [rubygems](http://rubygems.org) but for now you have to build it yourself

```
 $ git clone https://github.com/slaney/swisclient.git

 $ cd swisclient

 $ gem build swisclient.gemspec 
  Successfully built RubyGem
